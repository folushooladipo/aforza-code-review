AFORZA TECHNICAL TEST - REACT NATIVE CANDIDATE 

The files in this directory are 3 simple React Native components.

Each file has a description of the intended functionality. HOWEVER...
There are several issues with the implementation!  

We would like you to code review these files and be ready to discuss your findings and any comments you might have :)

For anything you find, tell us the following:
1. What is the issue?
2. Why is it a problem?
3. How could you fix it?

Things to think about:

1. Are there any outright errors?
2. Is there going to be any unexpected or unpredictable behaviour?
3. Is this best practise? If not, why not?
4. How easy will this be to maintain?
5. Is the code fragile for any reason?
6. Is there anything you think we should add or take out?

Tip: Feel free to add comments to the code to help highlight flaws and explain the issues, and how you could fix them.
